#+TITLE: Implementation notes

* Python Packages

* Julia & CUDA
CUDA_HOME is used for julia to detect CUDA. However, it still does not seem to
find CUDNN successfully. Thus I'm going to just use docker VM to run julia code
as well. However, is cuda and cudnn setup in the VM like tensorflow?

It is pretty messy, I'm using docker container instead, which works fine.

* Environment variables

There are two places to set env variables, and both seem to work AFTER LOGOUT.


#+BEGIN_SRC nix
  environment.variables = {
    # typically cudnn is installed into CUDA path, however NixOS install them
    # separately. This is for julia to detect libcudnn, but julia will warn this.
    CUDA_HOME = "${pkgs.cudatoolkit_10}";
    CUDA_PATH = "${pkgs.cudnn_cudatoolkit_10}";
    HELLO2 = "world";
  };
#+END_SRC



The "session" variables are set by PAM, so is it for X11 session?

#+BEGIN_SRC nix
  environment.sessionVariables = {
    CUDA_HOME = "${pkgs.cudatoolkit_10}";
    HELLO = ["world2" "world1"];
  };
#+END_SRC
